# Rebase the ClickHouse JS Client Test Branch

`clickhouse-js-client-release-test` is a permanent e2e testing branch that is **never merged into main**. It exists solely to test `@clickhouse/client` HEAD builds against HyperDX. Because it never lands, it must be periodically rebased as main moves forward.

## Branch structure

The branch always looks like this (top to bottom):

```
<lockfile-only commit>   ← message "yarn", only touches yarn.lock — always drop this
<real change commits>    ← e.g. "approve", "use head" — keep these
<main history>
```

The lockfile commit is the one that always conflicts on rebase, so the workflow is: drop it, rebase the real commits, then regenerate the lockfile fresh.

## Steps

### 1. Fetch latest main

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

### 2. Identify and drop the lockfile-only commit

Find the top commit(s) that touch only `yarn.lock`. The simplest check: if the top commit's diff is exclusively `yarn.lock`, it's the lockfile commit. Note the commit hash of the oldest real change commit — that's your rebase base.

```bash
git show --stat HEAD   # confirm it's lockfile-only
```

The real commits sit below it. You need to rebase `HEAD~N` (excluding the lockfile commit) onto `origin/main`, where N depends on how many real commits there are.

Use `--onto` to be explicit:

```bash
# Drop top 1 lockfile commit, rebase the rest onto origin/main
git rebase --onto origin/main <lockfile-commit-hash> HEAD~1
```

Or equivalently, identify the merge-base and rebase with an interactive-style onto. The key is that `yarn.lock` must NOT be part of what you rebase — it will be regenerated.

### 3. Resolve conflicts

During rebase, conflicts are most likely in `.yarnrc.yml` (the `npmPreapprovedPackages` list). When resolving:

- **Keep both sides** — don't drop entries that main added. The list should contain all entries from both sides.

Example resolution for `npmPreapprovedPackages`:
```yaml
npmPreapprovedPackages:
  - '@hyperdx/*'     # from main
  - "@clickhouse/*"  # from this branch
```

After resolving:
```bash
git add <conflicted-file>
GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue
```

### 4. Verify the change is complete

All packages that depend on `@clickhouse/client` must pin to `"head"`. After rebase, check:

```bash
grep -r "@clickhouse/client" packages/*/package.json
```

Every hit should show `"head"`, not a semver like `"^1.x.x"`. Currently the relevant files are:
- `packages/common-utils/package.json` — `@clickhouse/client`, `@clickhouse/client-common`, `@clickhouse/client-web`
- `packages/cli/package.json` — `@clickhouse/client`, `@clickhouse/client-common`

If any package still has a semver version, update it to `"head"` and amend the relevant commit.

### 5. Regenerate the lockfile

```bash
yarn
```

This resolves `@clickhouse/client*` to the current HEAD build (e.g. `1.x.x-head.<sha>.1`). The existing `yarn.lock` entries for those packages will be replaced.

### 6. Commit the lockfile

```bash
git add yarn.lock
git commit -m "yarn"
```

### 7. Force-push

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin clickhouse-js-client-release-test
```

`--force-with-lease` is safe here because this branch is intentionally non-fast-forward after every rebase.

## After the rebase

Confirm the branch log looks right:

```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
```

Expected output: the lockfile commit on top, the real change commits below it, nothing else.
