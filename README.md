# HyperDX

[HyperDX](https://hyperdx.io), a core component of
[ClickStack](https://clickhouse.com/use-cases/observability), helps engineers
quickly figure out why production is broken by making it easy to search &
visualize logs and traces on top of any ClickHouse cluster (imagine Kibana, for
ClickHouse).

  SQL optional!
- üìä Analyze trends in anomalies with event deltas
- üîî Set up alerts in just a few clicks
- üìà Dashboard high cardinality events without a complex query language
- `{` Native JSON string querying
- ‚ö° Live tail logs and traces to always get the freshest events
- üî≠ OpenTelemetry supported out of the box
- ‚è±Ô∏è Monitor health and performance from HTTP requests to DB queries (APM)

## Spinning Up HyperDX

HyperDX can be deployed as part of ClickStack, which includes ClickHouse,
HyperDX, OpenTelemetry Collector and MongoDB.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 docker.hyperdx.io/hyperdx/hyperdx-all-in-one
```

Afterwards, you can visit http://localhost:8080 to access the HyperDX UI.

If you already have an existing ClickHouse instance, want to use a single
container locally, or are looking for production deployment instructions, you
can view the different deployment options in our
[deployment docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment).

> If your server is behind a firewall, you'll need to open/forward port 8080,
> 8000 and 4318 on your firewall for the UI, API and OTel collector
> respectively.

> We recommend at least 4GB of RAM and 2 cores for testing.

### Hosted ClickHouse Cloud

You can also deploy HyperDX with ClickHouse Cloud, you can
[sign up for free](https://console.clickhouse.cloud/signUp) and get started in
just minutes.

## Instrumenting Your App

To get logs, metrics, traces, session replay, etc into HyperDX, you'll need to
instrument your app to collect and send telemetry data over to your HyperDX
instance.

We provide a set of SDKs and integration options to make it easier to get
started with HyperDX, such as
[Browser](https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack/sdks/browser),
[Node.js](https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack/sdks/nodejs),
and
[Python](https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack/sdks/python)

You can find the full list in
[our docs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/use-cases/observability/clickstack).

**OpenTelemetry**

Additionally, HyperDX is compatible with
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), a vendor-neutral standard for
instrumenting your application backed by CNCF. Supported languages/platforms
include:

- Kubernetes
- Javascript
- Python
- Java
- Go
- Ruby
- PHP
- .NET
- Elixir
- Rust

(Full list [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/))

Once HyperDX is running, you can point your OpenTelemetry SDK to the
OpenTelemetry collector spun up at `http://localhost:4318`.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions! There's many ways to contribute to the project,
including but not limited to:

- Opening a PR ([Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md))
- [Submitting feature requests or bugs](https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx/issues/new)
- Improving our product or contribution documentation
- Voting on [open issues](https://github.com/hyperdxio/hyperdx/issues) or
  contributing use cases to a feature request

## Motivation

Our mission is to help engineers ship reliable software. To enable that, we
believe every engineer needs to be able to easily leverage production telemetry
to quickly solve burning production issues.

However, in our experience, the existing tools we've used tend to fall short in
a few ways:

1. They're expensive, and the pricing has failed to scale with TBs of telemetry
   becoming the norm, leading to teams aggressively cutting the amount of data
   they can collect.
2. They're hard to use, requiring full-time SREs to set up, and domain experts
   to use confidently.
3. They requiring hopping from tool to tool (logs, session replay, APM,
   exceptions, etc.) to stitch together the clues yourself.

We hope you give HyperDX in ClickStack a try and let us know how we're doing!

## HyperDX Usage Data

HyperDX collects anonymized usage data for open source deployments. This data
supports our mission for observability to be available to any team and helps
support our open source product run in a variety of different environments.
While we hope you will continue to support our mission in this way, you may opt
out of usage data collection by setting the `USAGE_STATS_ENABLED` environment
variable to `false`. Thank you for supporting the development of HyperDX!
